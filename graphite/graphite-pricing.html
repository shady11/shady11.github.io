							<h4>Demand</h4>
							<p>
								Demand for graphite demand is driven by five key areas:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Steel production uses graphite for crucibles and casting shapes, as such, demand in this area is dependent on activity levels in the steel industry</li>
								<li>Li-on batteries, use graphite to construct the battery anode. This area is experiencing substantial growth as the use of battery technology spreads beyond its existing market of computers and mobile phones into the areas of green energy and electric vehicles; as the growth in these markets gathers momentum so graphite demand will multiply</li>
								<li>Automotive, primarily brake linings, bearings and seals as an important substitute for asbestos</li>
								<li>Expanded Graphite is used to insulate molten metal in steel making, fitted as fire stops around selected doors and pipes in buildings and in the manufacture of extreme-performance gaskets.</li>
								<li>Graphene, an advanced atomic level, material that is shown to have exceptional electrical, tensile/mechanical, optical and biological properties; as such graphene has huge future potential applications in many fields such as electronics, construction and materials. </li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								The current key drivers are steel and batteries. Batteries now comprise approximately 25 per cent of the market and this continues to grow substantially as the economics of the green energy revolution gain critical mass; with steel demand also recovering the demand picture for graphite is very favourable and the potential for higher prices significant.
							</p>
							<p>
								Lithium battery production is set to grow from 45 GWh in 2016 to over 140 GWh in 2020, driven by the expansion in electric vehicle use and increasing use of batteries in green energy systems. In both these areas this capacity increase is the result of initial take up demand and further expansion well beyond these limits is likely, for example the increasing replacement of lead-acid cells in data-centres and telecoms by Li-on batteries to provide power back up, the use of batteries to provide peak load capacity on national grids and the burgeoning switch to mass production of electric and hybrid vehicles.
							</p>
							<p>
								Graphite prices are reported as rising over 20% in the last few months of 2017, an indication that steel recovery and importantly, battery demand, is beginning push graphite prices an upward trajectory to join the earlier increase in lithium and cobalt, as the new factories in China and the US come on stream and major car manufacturers begin to phase out fossil fuel vehicles. It is reported that at there are at least 12 of these new battery mega-factories worldwide, seven of which are located in China and two in the US with more planned in Asia and Europe.
							</p>
							<h4>Supply</h4>
							<p>
								Approximately 75-80% of the worldâ€™s graphite supply is produced in China, India lies second (5-6%) then Brazil (4-5%) with Turkey, Canada, Sri Lanka and others all taking smaller shares.
							</p>
							<p>
								Given this imbalance in supply it is not surprising that both the US and EU include graphite on their lists of strategic minerals and the situation in China regarding production and demand is under constant scrutiny.
							</p>
							<p>
								Approximately 30% of Chinese production is flake graphite and the huge growth in their domestic steel industry during the last twenty years and now the seven or eight mega factories coming on line for battery production has created a domestic demand that is likely to consume internal graphite production, leaving a potential supply gap requiring mines outside China to fill.
							</p>
							<p>
								However, in the West there are few operating mines and fewer that can operate at low cost, this is the potential for new low cost, low capital mines to enter the market.
